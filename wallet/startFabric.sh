Next, use the Wallet applications to interact with the deployed Wallet contract.
The Wallet applications are available in multiple programming languages.
Follow the instructions for the programming language of your choice:

JavaScript:

  Start by changing into the "javascript" directory:
    cd javascript

  Next, install all required packages:
    npm install

  Then run the following applications to enroll the admin user, and register a new user
  called user1 which will be used by the other applications to interact with the deployed
  Wallet contract:
    node enrollAdmin
    node registerUser

  You can run the invoke application as follows. By default, the invoke application will
  create a new record, but you can update the application to submit other transactions:
    node invoke

  You can run the query application as follows. By default, the query application will
  return all records, but you can update the application to evaluate other transactions:
    node query
